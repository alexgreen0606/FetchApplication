(These instructions are for the MacBook command line)

Make sure maven is installed on your device.

This application runs on Java 1.8 using a Spring framework.
To use a different version of java, you must go into the pom.xml file and change the <java.version>HERE</java.version> attribute to make HERE = your java version.

Navigate to the FetchApplication directory in your command line.

Enter:      ./mvnw spring-boot:run

The web service should be booted at:    http://localhost:8080/


You can run multiple commands from the HTTP request, such as...

1.) To add a transaction with attributes (PAYER, POINTS, TIMESTAMP), type:

	http://localhost:8080/transaction?payer=PAYER&points=POINTS&timestamp=TIMESTAMP
 
	* make sure TIMESTAMP is of the format 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ' *

2.) To spend points with attribute (POINTS), type:

	http://localhost:8080/spend?points=POINTS

	* as long as you have enough points to spend and POINTS is positive, 
	a list of payers and the points they spent will be printed *

3.) To see all the payers and their total points, type:

	http://localhost:8080/spend?points=POINTS
